### Full-stack developer with a burning passion for game development

My passion for software development started at an early age, since I can remember, I've always wanted to build and share my ideas with others. This desire would eventually lead me to create my first “hello world” program at the age of 12 written in Java.  Now, several years later, I’ve had the privilege to lead and work alongside various teams and projects throughout the years, building and diversifying my skill set even further.
