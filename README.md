### Full-stack developer with a burning passion for game development

My passion for software / game development started at an early age, since I can remember, I've always wanted to build and share my ideas / worlds with others. This desire to build and share would eventually lead me to create my first “hello world” program at the age of 12 written in Java.  Now, several years later, I’ve had the privilege to lead and work alongside various teams throughout the years, building and diversifying my skill set even further.

It’s been a fun challenge learning to use all the various programming languages, tools, libraries and game engines I know today. Especially knowing that each time I’m a step closer to making those ideas / worlds of mine into a reality that I can share with others.
